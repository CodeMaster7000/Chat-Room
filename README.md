# Python Chat Room

## About 

A simple chat room coded in Python.

## Functions

Sockets: Sockets can be thought of as endpoints in a communication channel that is bi-directional and establishes communication between a server and one or more clients. In this case, I set up a socket on each end and allowed a client to interact with other clients via the server. 

Each user must use the client-side script to connect to the server.
